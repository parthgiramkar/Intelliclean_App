# Intelliclean: Automated Data Cleaning & EDA Tool üìä‚ú®

Intelliclean is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that automates the initial, often tedious, steps of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. Upload your dataset, configure the cleaning options, and get a clean dataset and a comprehensive EDA report in minutes.

## ## üöÄ Features

Intelliclean provides a robust pipeline for cleaning and understanding your data, combining automated actions with essential user controls.

#### ### Automated Cleaning Pipeline
* **Duplicate Removal:** Automatically detects and removes duplicate rows.
* **Missing Value Imputation:**
    * Fills missing numeric data with the **median**.
    * Fills missing categorical data with the **mode**.
    * Drops columns that exceed a high threshold of missing values (e.g., >60%).
* **Zero-Value Handling:** Converts numeric columns with a very high percentage of zeros (e.g., >95%) into a binary (0/1) format.

#### ### Proactive Transformations
* **Smart DateTime Splitting:** Automatically detects columns that are dates (not just times) and splits them into `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour` components.
* **Pattern-Based Splitting:** Identifies and splits complex string columns that match common patterns, such as ticket or cabin numbers (e.g., 'C85' -> prefix 'C', number '85').

#### ### User-Controlled Outlier Handling
* **Optional Log Transformation:** Users can choose to apply a log transformation (`log1p`) to fix numeric columns that are identified as having high skewness.
* **Manual Column Exclusion:** Provides a multi-select dropdown in the sidebar for the user to **protect** specific columns (like `Age`, `ID`, or `longitude`) from being automatically transformed.

#### ### Interactive Visualizations & Reports
* **"Before & After" Plots:** Instantly visualize the impact of cleaning operations with side-by-side distribution plots for any numeric or categorical column.
* **Full EDA Report:** Generates a comprehensive and interactive EDA report for both the original and the cleaned dataframes, powered by `ydata-profiling`.
* **Correlation Summary:** Displays a list of highly correlated columns identified during the analysis.

#### ### Data Export
* **Download Cleaned Data:** Easily download the final, cleaned dataset as a **CSV** or **JSON** file.
